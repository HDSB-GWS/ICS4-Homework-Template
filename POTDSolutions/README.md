# POTD Solutions

## Put your solutions to the problems of the day into this folder.

1. You are required to commit and push your changes to your repository **even if you have not completed it**.  Upload your best attempt at the challenge.
2. Organize your solutions into folders pertaining the practice topic and files named correctly with respect to the question involved.
3. If working on the problems using repl with GitHub intergration, make sure to set your .replit file to run the practice file you want. For example, here's a file called `Question1.java` that will run from the `operator practice` folder in python practice:

```
language="java11"
run = "javac 'operator practice/Question1.java' && java -classpath 'operator practice/' Question1"
```
